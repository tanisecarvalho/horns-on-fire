## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was defined using the colours on the logo.

* `#F1473A` was used for H1, input text and main container background.
* `#EDEDED` was used as primary colour for the website text and H2.
* `#171717` was used for background colour in case the image does not load, buttons text and border, and rules div background.
* `#F79326` was used for buttons background.

### Typography

I have used Google Fonts to select and import the font used on this website.

* For the quiz name, buttons and headings the font used is [New Rocker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/New+Rocker). As the name, the font is very similar to band logos. 

![New Rocker Font](docs/new_rocker.JPG)

* For the body of the page the font used is [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) as the font is very clear to understand and matches with New Rocker.

### Imagery

The logo and background were created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The horns was chosen to be the logo as it is a caracteristic symbol for rock n' roll fans. And from using the symbol is that the name of the quiz came to life. The fire on the name is because it is common to say of a concert that the band was on fire.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Remote Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  * On the left side menu, on the section Code and automation, click on Pages.
  * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Deploy from a branch.
  * From the branch section drop-down menu, select main, right on the side select /root.
  * Once the the branch menus have been selected, github will create the page. It might take a few minutes. Once it is done a link will show up on the top of the page.

The live link can be found here - []()

### Forking
To fork this site go to its GitHub repository [insert link here]
  * On the top right of the page there's a button with the option Fork, click on it.
  * A new page "Create a new fork" will open. If you wish, you can edit the name.
  * In the end of the page click on the button "Create fork".
  * Now you have a copy of the project on your repositories.

### Local Deployment
This site was developed using Gitpod. To edit your copy on Gitpod you will need to: 
  * On your browser of choice install the gitpod extension/add-on.
  * On GitHub open the project repository you forked before.
  * On the top of the page, over the files, there is a green button on the right side of the page saying "Gitpod". Click it.
  * It will open the Gitpod website. On the first time, you will select to connect with your GitHub account and Authorize gitpod-io. After that you'll be creating an account.
      * It might take a while after that because gitpod will be creating your workspace.
  * After the workspace is loaded, you're able to edit it on Gitpod.

## Testing

Please check the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for all the tests.
