## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- | 
| I want this website to be responsive to my device. | The site was developed with responsiveness in mind and a mobile-first approach. | 
| I want to easily navigate on this website. | The site works with only one page. All the content loaded within the main section have buttons with actions that will lead the user to the expected function. The logo also works as a link to the first state of the page. | 
| I want to be able to play this quiz to test my 80's and 90's Hard Rock knowledge. | All the questions on the quiz were created focusing on the Hard Rock from the 80's and 90's. | 
| I want to select different categories to play. | I created three different cateogries for the user to select. | 
| I want to know if I selected the correct option. | When the user select their answer, the colour on the options' buttons change: green if it's correct and red if it's incorrect. | 
| I want to know my score. | The score is displayed and updated during the whole game above the question. The score is also displayed when the game finish. | 
| I want to check my scores. | A leaderboard was created and it saves the last 10 best scores played on the browser. I used localStorage to save the scores. | 
| I want to check the rules. | A button was created that loads the rules for the user. It's accessible before the user start a new game. |

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

When accessing the site on the iPhone SE 2020, on the Main Page, the text "Choose a category" is not centralised. I couldn't reproduce it on Devtools, and in other mobile devices it's working correctly.
